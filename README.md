## Authors:
- **David W Hogg** *(Flatiron) (MPIA) (NYU)*
- **Megan Bedell** *(Flatiron)*

## Projects:
- A paper on how you measure a radial velocity in the invariant-spectrum case.
- Code that implements all the methods and tests.
- (Maybe) a paper on how you measure a radial velocity in the presence of spectral variability?
